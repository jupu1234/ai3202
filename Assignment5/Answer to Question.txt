The epsilon value that changes the route of my program is approximately 3.3. Any value less 
than epsilon = 3.3 has a different path than every any value of epsilon greater than 3.3. 
This is because when epsilon is 3.3 the program only runs once since delta will already 
be less than epsilon*(1 - gamma)/gamma. 

The values I tried for epsilon where 0, 0.001, 0.5, 2, 3, 4, 10. I noticed the change when 
I went from epsilon = 3 to epsilon = 4. I then found at 3.3 is when the change occurs.
